# Farcaster Frame for DevCon 7 Raffle

## Project Overview

The Farcaster Frame for DevCon 7 Raffle is a dynamic and interactive tool designed to enhance the bidding experience for the DevCon 7 Raffle-Auction.

By leveraging the power of Farcaster, we aim to provide a seamless and engaging experience for all participants.
